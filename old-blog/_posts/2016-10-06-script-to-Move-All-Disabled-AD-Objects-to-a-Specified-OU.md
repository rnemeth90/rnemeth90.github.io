The title says it all. This script will move all disabled AD objects to a specified OU. This script accepts parameters that will allow you to specify whether you want to move Users or Computers and the destination OU. It also accepts a “test mode” parameter that will run the script and output the results, without actually modifying Active Directory.

This is revision 1 of the script. There are still several improvements I would like to make, including better error handling and recovery.

If you have any suggestions or requests, please leave a comment.
