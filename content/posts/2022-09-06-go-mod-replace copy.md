If you want to the local version of a dependency in Go rather than one in a remote repository, use the **replace** keyword.

The replace line goes above your require statements, like so:

~~~shell

    module github.com/rnemeth90/foo

    replace github.com/rnemeth90/bar => /Users/rnemeth90/Projects/bar

    require (
    	github.com/rnemeth90/bar v1.0.0
    )
~~~

Now when you compile this module **go build** or **go install**, it will use your local code rather than the remote dependency.

According to the docs, you do need to make sure that the code you‚Äôre pointing to also has a **go.mod** file:

> **Note**: if the right-hand side of a `replace` directive is a filesystem path, then the target must have a `go.mod` file at that location. If the `go.mod` file is not present, you can create one with `go mod init`.

You can also create this line from the command line using the **go mod edit** command.

    $ go mod edit -replace github.com/rnemeth90/bar=/Users/rnemeth90/Projects/bar

Following the **\-replace** is first what you want to replace, then an equals sign, then what you‚Äôre replacing it with.

Hopefully this helps someone who was stuck with this like me üôÇ
