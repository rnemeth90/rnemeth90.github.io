I'm not really a fan of photography. I don't particularly enjoy the intracies of tuning a high-end DSLR camera. Nor am I a fan of being out in nature to photograph a fall sunrise (though, that does sound peaceful). However, I do take a lot of pictures with my phone (currently, a Pixel 6). Moreso now that I am a new father. I am protective of these photos. So much that I sync them automatically from my phone to two cloud storage solutions. I thought the other day, how painful it would be for either of these cloud storage providers to go offline. Though unlikely, anything is possible, right?

So, like any good engineer, I started looking for a solution for this concern. I have 2 Synology NAS devices here at my home. Calling a Synology a NAS is almost an insult. They are much more than that. Though they specialize in storage, they provide a plethora of apps. A Synology device can provide storage, email, DNS, media, etc. services though OEM and third-party apps.

On the next page, enter in your Storage Account info and then click Next. You can then choose which local folders on your Synology to backup:
