# Introduction

Combining multiple Kubernetes secrets into a single directory can streamline secret management in your applications. This guide walks you through the process of achieving this in Kubernetes, ensuring efficient and organized secret management.

# Creating Secrets

First, create your secrets using the `kubectl create secret` command:

```
kubectl create secret generic secret-one --from-literal=key1=value1
kubectl create secret generic secret-two --from-literal=key2=value2
```

Each secret can contain multiple key-value pairs, and you can add more secrets as needed.

# Configuring the Pod

Next, define the pod configuration to mount these secrets into a single directory. Hereâ€™s an example configuration:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mypod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: mycontainer
    image: myimage
    volumeMounts:
    - name: secret-volume1
      mountPath: "/etc/secrets/secret-one"
      subPath: key1
    - name: secret-volume2
      mountPath: "/etc/secrets/secret-two"
      subPath: key2
  volumes:
  - name: secret-volume1
    secret:
      secretName: secret-one
  - name: secret-volume2
    secret:
      secretName: secret-two
```

# Detailed Explanation

- Volume Mounts: The `volumeMounts` section specifies where the secrets will be mounted within the container's file system. By using the `subPath` property, you can place each secret's content into a specific file within the target directory.
- Volumes: The volumes section links each volume to a Kubernetes secret. This ensures that the secrets are available to the container at runtime.

In this example, secret-one and secret-two are mounted into `/etc/secrets/secret-one` and `/etc/secrets/secret-two`, respectively. The `subPath` ensures that each key-value pair from the secrets is mapped to a separate file within the specified directory.

# Conclusion

By mounting secrets into subdirectories using the `subPath` property, you can effectively manage multiple secrets within a single directory. This method enhances organization and accessibility, making it easier to handle secrets in your Kubernetes applications.
