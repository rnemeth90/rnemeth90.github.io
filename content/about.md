My name is Ryan Nemeth and this is my personal blog. I write down my thoughts regarding Microsoft Azure, Kubernetes, cloud-native technologies, and software development. I find that documenting these things not only helps others but also helps reinforce my own knowledge as well. I may also blog about life or other random things from time to time.

This blog has had many lives over the years. It originally started as a Blogger blog way back in 2012, moved to Wordpress for a while, then back to blogger, then to Ghost (running on a small droplet over @ DigitalOcean), then back to Wordpress again, and now here on Github pages. That's a lot of change (such is life)! So if you happen to come across a page that has some weird formatting, missing images, etc. Please be kind and let me know so that I may fix it.

I'm currently working remote as a Senior DevOps Engineer/SRE for Aprimo on the Systems team.

Before joining Aprimo, I was a cloud architect for a software company specializing in HCM software.

The opinions expressed here are my own personal opinions, and do not represent my employerâ€™s view in any way.
