After forcing the sync, I opened miisclient and noticed some strange errors. We sync multiple on-prem AD forests to Azure AD, and the status for one of them was “no-start-connection”.

The two sites are connected via a S2S VPN.</p><p>There was obviously some type of connection issue between our two datacenters. In my case, the issue was transient, and resolved itself after a few minutes. But if you’re experiencing this error message, check your L2/L3 connection. Also, verify DNS is working and someone didn’t make changes to your firewall(s). Just walk up or down the OSI model and you’ll eventually find the problem.</p></div><footer></footer></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container>©
