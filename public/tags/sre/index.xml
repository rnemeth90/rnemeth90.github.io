      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This post covers a simple and efficient solution for implementing liveness probes in pods running console applications (think background services or utility DaemonSets). A common question I see in Kubernetes forums is:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;“How do I use health probes with console apps?”&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The typical responses often suggest:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Sidecar Container with HTTP Server: Requires coding the server, building a sidecar container, and managing additional infrastructure. While effective, this can be overkill for lightweight applications.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Exec Probes with Shell Scripts: Feels hacky and can waste resources, depending on what the script does.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Pods are meant to be lightweight, and both solutions can deviate from that principle.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was recently involved with troubleshooting some API&amp;rsquo;s hosted in Kubernetes throwing http/502&amp;rsquo;s. This was incredibly difficult to diagnose because it seemingly happened at random, and I had never encountered anything like this. Being that I had never dealt with this in the past, and I (nor my team) was able to figure it out within a reasonable amount of time, I turned to google. My searches resulted in various blogs and SO posts of other people experiencing similar issues, but none of their resolutions worked for us. It was actually a combination of these blogs (and the resolutions posted) that ended up resolving our issue.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
