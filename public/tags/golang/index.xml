      <title>Detecting MIME Types in Go</title>

      <description>Introduction Link to heading Knowing the type of a file you&amp;rsquo;re working with is not just a matter of curiosity — it&amp;rsquo;s often a necessity. This is especially true when you&amp;rsquo;re deciding whether or not a particular operation can be carried out on that file. Go, with its comprehensive standard library, offers a straightforward approach to identifying a file&amp;rsquo;s MIME type, ensuring that developers have the tools they need to make informed decisions about file manipulation.</description>

      <title>Validating URLs with Go</title>

      <description>Introduction Link to heading In this post, we&amp;rsquo;ll take a quick look at URL validation using Golang. It&amp;rsquo;s common to implement URL validation as a task within a HTTP request pipeline, typically as middleware. There are many different definitions of &amp;ldquo;validation&amp;rdquo;. For the purpose of this article, we will simply validate that a URL conforms to a particular text pattern.&#xA;I often see people (mistakenly) use URL and URI interchangeably.</description>

      <title>Golang: When Identical Strings are Not Equal</title>

      <description>This will be a quick and dirty post, so please forgive any spelling/grammar mistakes.&#xA;I was writing a little CLI tool in Golang to track todo items. Just a dumb little app to help hone my skills a bit, but still something useful that serves a purpose to me. I don&amp;rsquo;t write a ton of code at work (mostly just scripting/pipelines when I do), so I&amp;rsquo;m constantly working on something like this in my spare time.</description>

      <title>Building a Golang App with Github Actions</title>

      <description>In this article, we&amp;rsquo;ll take a quick look at building a Golang app with Github actions. This process can be applied to just about any app written in any language though. We&amp;rsquo;ll cover the following:&#xA;What are github actions? Setting up the workflow to build, test, and deploy a binary Github Actions is a cross-platform CI/CD pipeline that allows you to build, test, package, and release your software. Actions can be triggered manually or based on events that happen within your Github repo.</description>

      <title>Use “replace” in go.mod to Point to a Local Module</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/2022-09-06-go-mod-replace-copy/</link>

      <description>If you want to the local version of a dependency in Go rather than one in a remote repository, use the replace keyword.&#xA;The replace line goes above your require statements, like so:&#xA;module github.com/rnemeth90/foo replace github.com/rnemeth90/bar =&amp;gt; /Users/rnemeth90/Projects/bar require ( github.com/rnemeth90/bar v1.0.0 ) Now when you compile this module go build or go install, it will use your local code rather than the remote dependency.&#xA;According to the docs, you do need to make sure that the code you’re pointing to also has a go.</description>

      <title>Reading Json Files with Go</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/2022-07-21-reading-json-files-with-go/</link>

      <description>JSON is a widely used format for representing structured data. Developers like it because it is easy to read, most common languages have a library for interacting with it, and most public APIs accept JSON in HTTP requests.&#xA;In this post, we&amp;rsquo;ll look at parsing a JSON file using Go! We will be using the io/ioutil package to open a json file on local disk, and encoding/json to parse the JSON data within the file into a memory structure.</description>
