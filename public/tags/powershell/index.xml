      <description>&lt;p&gt;Despite being a great language, PowerShell is not impervious to errors. Errors that occur within your code can stop it&amp;rsquo;s execution or even cause unexpected changes in the resources that your script is managing. Learning to handle these errors gracefully is the foundation of defensive coding. Today, we&amp;rsquo;ll take a quick look at how PowerShell handles errors with Try-Catch-Finally blocks. They allow you to gracefully handle errors and perform cleanup operations, ensuring that your script doesn&amp;rsquo;t crash when the unexpected occurs. We&amp;rsquo;ll then cover the differences in terminating and non-terminating errors and why you should take these into consideration when implementing error handling.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Powershell for Devops - Querying REST APIs with Powershell</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This will be a short post on querying REST APIs with Powershell.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s hard to argue that REST APIs are the predominant technology for interacting&#xA;with networked services. They provide a gateway for interacting with a 3rd party (or self-hosted)&#xA;product without having to go through the exercise of a more complicated integration. REST APIs communicate&#xA;in a common format, typically JSON. However, most will allow us to choose the response format by specifying an&#xA;option in the &amp;lsquo;Accept&amp;rsquo; header.  Most languages provide a native method for interacting with&#xA;REST APIs. This objective for this post is to show you how simple this is with Powershell.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Remove Kubernetes Namespace Stuck in the Terminating State</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this post, we will discuss how to remove a Kubernetes namespace that is stuck in the ‘terminating’ state.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A namespace is like a container. You can use it to store related objects in a Kubernetes environment. Maybe you are hosting a blog in Kubernetes. This blog will likely have a database, a frontend website, a load balancer (service) to spread the incoming traffic among ‘x’ number of frontend containers (pods), and maybe some middle-tier or utility applications. One day, you decide you no longer want this blog, so you plan to delete it. Rather than tediously deleting all of the various entities associated with this blog, you can delete the namespace that contains these entities. This will essentially ‘cascade delete’ the resources within the namespace as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
