      <title>Nginx Ingress Response Header Size - A Cautionary Tale</title>

      <description>This will be a short post about a recent issue I encountered when using Nginx as a Kubernetes ingress. Though, this could also be encountered when using Nginx as a reverse proxy as well. The two definitions are functionally similar.&#xA;We recently had a client call in complaining of our application returning random 502s (Bad Gateway).&#xA;After some investigation and the common finger-pointing, I found this entry in the logs of our ingress controllers:</description>

      <title>Handling Graceful Shutdown in a .NET App Hosted in Kubernetes</title>

      <description>I was recently involved with troubleshooting some API&amp;rsquo;s hosted in Kubernetes throwing http/502&amp;rsquo;s. This was incredibly difficult to diagnose because it seemingly happened at random, and I had never encountered anything like this. Being that I had never dealt with this in the past, and I (nor my team) was able to figure it out within a reasonable amount of time, I turned to google. My searches resulted in various blogs and SO posts of other people experiencing similar issues, but none of their resolutions worked for us.</description>

      <title>AKS Scale Down Mode</title>

      <description>By default, scale-out operations performed manually or by cluster autoscale rules require the allocation and provisioning of new nodes, and scale-in operations delete nodes. Scale-down mode is a relatively newer concept that allows us to choose whether to delete or deallocate nodes.&#xA;Having the ability to deallocate, rather than delete, nodes is a major performance benefit, as the time it takes to spin up new nodes will be significantly decreased. You will not be charged when nodes are deallocated.</description>

      <title>Scheduled Kubernetes Worker Node Maintenance with Kured</title>

      <description>If you manage Linux nodes, you know how vital performing regular maintenance is. Installing software patches that modify Linux kernel headers requires a reboot. Normally, as in the past, we would cordon and drain the node and then manually reboot, wait for it to come back online, verify its health, and add it back to the cluster. That’s a lot of manual work! How can we automate this?&#xA;Weaveworks created a great tool for simplifying these steps: Kured (the Kubernetes Reboot Daemon).</description>

      <description>I have somewhat of a niche issue, where I have no network connectivity while connecting to my work VPN inside of WSL v2. I have found others complaining about this issue on Github. Though no one seems to know how to fix it and I have not had the time to properly investigate.&#xA;Because of this, I’m required to continue using WSL v1. Though, with WSL v1, Docker does not work.</description>

      <title>Remove Kubernetes Namespace Stuck in the Terminating State</title>

      <description>In this post, we will discuss how to remove a Kubernetes namespace that is stuck in the ‘terminating’ state.&#xA;A namespace is like a container. You can use it to store related objects in a Kubernetes environment. Maybe you are hosting a blog in Kubernetes. This blog will likely have a database, a frontend website, a load balancer (service) to spread the incoming traffic among ‘x’ number of frontend containers (pods), and maybe some middle-tier or utility applications.</description>

      <title>Kubernetes Storage Simplified</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/2022-03-01-kubernetes-storage-simplified/</link>

      <description>In this blog post, we will attempt to explain the current storage options that exist in Kubernetes. If you are new to Kubernetes, learning about its capabilities of managing the application state can be a daunting task.&#xA;Container images are built-in layers, with the runtime layer being writable. However, any files on this writable layer are only available for the container’s lifetime. We can mount a volume to a directory inside the container to have persistent data.</description>

      <description>In this article, we will dive into the process of pod eviction in a Kubernetes cluster, how you can pod prevent pod eviction, and how you can recover from such a situation.&#xA;What is Pod Eviction? Link to heading Kubernetes pod eviction is a type of involuntary service disruption in which a pod is forcefully stopped on a node or fails to be scheduled on a node. Pod eviction can happen for a variety of reasons.</description>

      <description>In this post, we’ll take a look at deploying a highly available sFTP solution to Azure Kubernetes with user files stored in an Azure NFSv4 File Share. The sFTP application reads user credentials from a file named users.conf, containing secrets from an Azure Key Vault.&#xA;Here is the link to my Github account where you can download the code mentioned in this article:&#xA;https://github.com/rnemeth90/kubernetes-sftp&#xA;We will work through the following steps in this article:</description>
