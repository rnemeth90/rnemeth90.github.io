      <description>I was recently involved with troubleshooting some API&amp;rsquo;s hosted in Kubernetes throwing http/502&amp;rsquo;s. This was incredibly difficult to diagnose because it seemingly happened at random, and I had never encountered anything like this. Being that I had never dealt with this in the past, and I (nor my team) was able to figure it out within a reasonable amount of time, I turned to google. My searches resulted in various blogs and SO posts of other people experiencing similar issues, but none of their resolutions worked for us.</description>

      <description>This problem has bitten me more than once, and I can never remember how to fix it. So, why not write a blog post about it!&#xA;When running EF Core migrations in a solution, you may come across this error:&#xA;There are several apparent causes. However, in my case (every time I have seen this), it has been caused by having multiple startup projects selected in Visual Studio.&#xA;To fix this, simply open your Solution properties and set the startup project to ‘Current Selection’.</description>
