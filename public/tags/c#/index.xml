      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was recently involved with troubleshooting some API&amp;rsquo;s hosted in Kubernetes throwing http/502&amp;rsquo;s. This was incredibly difficult to diagnose because it seemingly happened at random, and I had never encountered anything like this. Being that I had never dealt with this in the past, and I (nor my team) was able to figure it out within a reasonable amount of time, I turned to google. My searches resulted in various blogs and SO posts of other people experiencing similar issues, but none of their resolutions worked for us. It was actually a combination of these blogs (and the resolutions posted) that ended up resolving our issue.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This problem has bitten me more than once, and I can never remember how to fix it. So, why not write a blog post about it!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When running EF Core migrations in a solution, you may come across this error:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://rnemeth90.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image-1-1024x142.png&#34;  class=&#34;external-link&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are several apparent causes. However, in my case (every time I have seen this), it has been caused by having multiple startup projects selected in Visual Studio.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To fix this, simply open your Solution properties and set the startup project to ‘Current Selection’.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
