      <description>Azure Policy allows us to control what actions users can perform regarding creating and managing resources in Azure. We can define policies for naming standards, require that certain extensions be installed on virtual machines, audit various resources for certain configurations… the possibilities are endless.&#xA;In this article, well focus on defining what locations users can deploy resources in. To get started, login to the Azure Portal and search for “Policy”.</description>

      <title>Ping Sweeping with FPing</title>

      <description>I generally use NMAP for any type of host discovery, but recently started experimenting with FPing. One thing I found is that, when performing a ping sweep, not only do I see the hosts that replied to the ping, but FPing also sends any unreachable IP addresses to stdout (which is super annoying and ugly if you ask me…).&#xA;Anyway, after a bit of research, I found a nifty way to suppress these messages.</description>
