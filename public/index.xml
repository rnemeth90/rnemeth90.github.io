      <description>Introduction Link to heading Combining multiple Kubernetes secrets into a single directory can streamline secret management in your applications. This guide walks you through the process of achieving this in Kubernetes, ensuring efficient and organized secret management.&#xA;Creating Secrets Link to heading First, create your secrets using the kubectl create secret command:&#xA;kubectl create secret generic secret-one --from-literal=key1=value1 kubectl create secret generic secret-two --from-literal=key2=value2 Each secret can contain multiple key-value pairs, and you can add more secrets as needed.</description>

      <description>Introduction Link to heading Knowing the type of a file you&amp;rsquo;re working with is not just a matter of curiosity — it&amp;rsquo;s often a necessity. This is especially true when you&amp;rsquo;re deciding whether or not a particular operation can be carried out on that file. Go, with its comprehensive standard library, offers a straightforward approach to identifying a file&amp;rsquo;s MIME type, ensuring that developers have the tools they need to make informed decisions about file manipulation.</description>

      <description>Introduction Link to heading In this post, we&amp;rsquo;ll take a quick look at URL validation using Golang. It&amp;rsquo;s common to implement URL validation as a task within a HTTP request pipeline, typically as middleware. There are many different definitions of &amp;ldquo;validation&amp;rdquo;. For the purpose of this article, we will simply validate that a URL conforms to a particular text pattern.&#xA;I often see people (mistakenly) use URL and URI interchangeably.</description>

      <title>Nginx Ingress Response Header Size - A Cautionary Tale</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/2023-12-04-nginx-ingress-resp-header-size/</link>

      <description>This will be a short post about a recent issue I encountered when using Nginx as a Kubernetes ingress. Though, this could also be encountered when using Nginx as a reverse proxy as well. The two definitions are functionally similar.&#xA;We recently had a client call in complaining of our application returning random 502s (Bad Gateway).&#xA;After some investigation and the common finger-pointing, I found this entry in the logs of our ingress controllers:</description>

      <description>Introduction Link to heading Netcat is a versatile networking utility that can be used for a wide range of tasks. It has often been referred to as the &amp;ldquo;network swiss-army knife&amp;rdquo;. Netcat was first released in the mid-90s, and I personally find it ironic to be blogging about it in 2023! But I feel like it is a somewhat cryptic tool, and new engineers or college graduates may not be familiar.</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/2023-08-15-powershell-try-catch/</guid>
      <description>Despite being a great language, PowerShell is not impervious to errors. Errors that occur within your code can stop it&amp;rsquo;s execution or even cause unexpected changes in the resources that your script is managing. Learning to handle these errors gracefully is the foundation of defensive coding. Today, we&amp;rsquo;ll take a quick look at how PowerShell handles errors with Try-Catch-Finally blocks. They allow you to gracefully handle errors and perform cleanup operations, ensuring that your script doesn&amp;rsquo;t crash when the unexpected occurs.</description>

      <description>This will be a quick and dirty post, so please forgive any spelling/grammar mistakes.&#xA;I was writing a little CLI tool in Golang to track todo items. Just a dumb little app to help hone my skills a bit, but still something useful that serves a purpose to me. I don&amp;rsquo;t write a ton of code at work (mostly just scripting/pipelines when I do), so I&amp;rsquo;m constantly working on something like this in my spare time.</description>

      <description>I was recently involved with troubleshooting some API&amp;rsquo;s hosted in Kubernetes throwing http/502&amp;rsquo;s. This was incredibly difficult to diagnose because it seemingly happened at random, and I had never encountered anything like this. Being that I had never dealt with this in the past, and I (nor my team) was able to figure it out within a reasonable amount of time, I turned to google. My searches resulted in various blogs and SO posts of other people experiencing similar issues, but none of their resolutions worked for us.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m not really a fan of photography. I don&amp;rsquo;t particularly enjoy the intracies of tuning a high-end DSLR camera. Nor am I a fan of being out in nature to photograph a fall sunrise (though, that does sound peaceful). However, I do take a lot of pictures with my phone (currently, a Pixel 6). Moreso now that I am a new father. I am protective of these photos. So much that I sync them automatically from my phone to two cloud storage providers.</description>

      <description>In this article, we&amp;rsquo;ll take a quick look at building a Golang app with Github actions. This process can be applied to just about any app written in any language though. We&amp;rsquo;ll cover the following:&#xA;What are github actions? Setting up the workflow to build, test, and deploy a binary Github Actions is a cross-platform CI/CD pipeline that allows you to build, test, package, and release your software.

      <description>In this article, we&amp;rsquo;ll take a quick look at chaining two pipelines together in Azure Devops, so that the completion of one pipeline, triggers the other to run. Microsoft documentation is leaps and bounds ahead of where it used to be. However, I still feel like there is a lot of room for improvement, as it took me a while to figure this out.&#xA;Our two pipelines will exist in the same repository.</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/2022-09-06-go-mod-replace-copy/</guid>
      <description>If you want to the local version of a dependency in Go rather than one in a remote repository, use the replace keyword.&#xA;The replace line goes above your require statements, like so:&#xA;module github.com/rnemeth90/foo replace github.com/rnemeth90/bar =&amp;gt; /Users/rnemeth90/Projects/bar require ( github.com/rnemeth90/bar v1.0.0 ) Now when you compile this module go build or go install, it will use your local code rather than the remote dependency.&#xA;According to the docs, you do need to make sure that the code you’re pointing to also has a go.</description>

      <description>This will be a short post on querying REST APIs with Powershell.&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s hard to argue that REST APIs are the predominant technology for interacting with networked services. They provide a gateway for interacting with a 3rd party (or self-hosted) product without having to go through the exercise of a more complicated integration. REST APIs communicate in a common format, typically JSON. However, most will allow us to choose the response format by specifying an option in the &amp;lsquo;Accept&amp;rsquo; header.</description>

      <description>JSON is a widely used format for representing structured data. Developers like it because it is easy to read, most common languages have a library for interacting with it, and most public APIs accept JSON in HTTP requests.&#xA;In this post, we&amp;rsquo;ll look at parsing a JSON file using Go! We will be using the io/ioutil package to open a json file on local disk, and encoding/json to parse the JSON data within the file into a memory structure.</description>

      <description>By default, scale-out operations performed manually or by cluster autoscale rules require the allocation and provisioning of new nodes, and scale-in operations delete nodes. Scale-down mode is a relatively newer concept that allows us to choose whether to delete or deallocate nodes.&#xA;Having the ability to deallocate, rather than delete, nodes is a major performance benefit, as the time it takes to spin up new nodes will be significantly decreased. You will not be charged when nodes are deallocated.</description>

      <description>If you manage Linux nodes, you know how vital performing regular maintenance is. Installing software patches that modify Linux kernel headers requires a reboot. Normally, as in the past, we would cordon and drain the node and then manually reboot, wait for it to come back online, verify its health, and add it back to the cluster. That’s a lot of manual work! How can we automate this?&#xA;Weaveworks created a great tool for simplifying these steps: Kured (the Kubernetes Reboot Daemon).</description>

      <description>In this post, we will discuss how to remove a Kubernetes namespace that is stuck in the ‘terminating’ state.&#xA;A namespace is like a container. You can use it to store related objects in a Kubernetes environment. Maybe you are hosting a blog in Kubernetes. This blog will likely have a database, a frontend website, a load balancer (service) to spread the incoming traffic among ‘x’ number of frontend containers (pods), and maybe some middle-tier or utility applications.</description>

      <description>We can inject configuration into containers using Kubernetes config maps and secrets. These objects can be consumed by a pod as environment variables, command-line arguments, or as configuration files mounted in a volume. For the subject of this article, we will focus on mounting multiple config maps/secrets into a single directory on a pod.&#xA;Mounting a configmap or secret in a Volume is relatively straightforward (for anyone familiar with Kubernetes primitives).</description>

      <description>In this blog post, we will attempt to explain the current storage options that exist in Kubernetes. If you are new to Kubernetes, learning about its capabilities of managing the application state can be a daunting task.&#xA;Container images are built-in layers, with the runtime layer being writable. However, any files on this writable layer are only available for the container’s lifetime. We can mount a volume to a directory inside the container to have persistent data.</description>

      <description>When deploying new software releases to servers or (insert -as-a-service&amp;gt; here), it’s a good idea to either deploy the releases in a controlled manner or to have a quick rollback plan. This article will be diving into blue/green deployments, canary deployments, ring-based deployments, and feature tag deployments.&#xA;Blue/Green Deployments Link to heading Blue/green deployments are a deployment model where a new application version never gets deployed to the production servers (green) directly.</description>

      <description>This article assumes that you have already created a pipeline in Azure Devops and have it linked to an Azure Devops repo. You will need to create a variable named $vmpassword and assign it the value stored in your key vault.&#xA;To create a release pipeline that will automatically create a VM (using the password stored in key vault for the local administrator account), do the following:&#xA;Create a new release pipeline 3.</description>

      <description>This will be the first article in a series about maintaining Azure tenants and subscriptions.&#xA;If you currently, or have ever, worked in a large Azure environment, you know how easily resource creep can occur. Resource Groups, VM disks and network interfaces, network security groups, etc. can easily fall out of sight and be forgotten about. This isn’t a big concern for resources that are free of cost, like resource groups.</description>

In addition to the links below, I also used Alan Rodrigues’ course on Udemy. https://www.udemy.com/course/az-102-azure-administrator-certification-transition/ The Udemy course and Microsoft Docs are enough to pass the exam. The course has some good practice exams and labs that align well with what you’ll see on the real exam regarding difficulty. I was scoring in the high 90’s on the Udemy exams.</description>

      <description>I recently ran into a situation in my lab environment that required I resync all (2000+) user accounts to Azure AD. Though this sounds complex and daunting, its actually quite simple. T&#xA;The basic steps involve disabling sync, and then removing the user objects. This can all be done with two PowerShell commands:&#xA;1) Set-MsolDirSyncEnabled -EnableDirSync $false&#xA;2) Get-MsolUser -All | Remove-MsolUser -force&#xA;The account that you are currently running the commands as will not be removed.</description>

      <description>If you are using VM Scale Sets in Azure, you know how important it can be to quickly obtain an instance IP address. This can of course be done using the Azure Portal. However, I am often working in a shell or VSCode, and I do not want to leave the comfort of my shell to login to the portal.&#xA;There are a few options we have for retrieving information about a VMSS and its instances without using the Azure Portal.</description>

      <description>Let’s say you have a VM in Azure North Central. You created this VM from a custom image that you maintain in an Azure image repository. Now, what if you wanted to create that same VM in Azure South Central, and use the same reference image? A standard image repository is limited to the region that it exists in. The answer here is to create a Shared Image Library, add the image to it, and then configure the image to replicate to other Azure regions.</description>

      <description>In Redhat/Fedora/Cent, GRUB can be protected by running the grub-md5-crypt command and pasting the outputted password hash into the grub.conf file. vSphere 6.0 password protects grub by default. If you change the root password in the VAMI, the GRUB password is changed to match. If you do not change the root password, the GRUB password is “vmware”.&#xA;To reset the GRUB password, we need to boot into a Cent or Redhat live CD.</description>

I was installing Exchange 2016 earlier today, to be used as a hybrid configuration server for Office 365 (no local mailboxes). I downloaded the self depackaging executable from Microsoft, and attempted to install it. If you currently have a hybrid configuration (which we did, with Exchange 2010), the Exchange 2016 installer will detect this and run some tests to verify that the Office 365 tenant is ready for Exchange 2016 (more info here: https://technet.</description>

If the files are lost, they can be quickly restored. You can also restore a file from a specific point in time, being that File History creates a complete history of your files over time. You will need a separate drive other than the one you have Windows 8 installed on to use File History.</description>

      <description>After deleting a user in Office 365, their account is moved to a ‘recycle bin’ for 30 days. This allows the user account to be easily recovered. This can often cause issues when attempting to recreate a mailbox while a hybrid configuration is in place.&#xA;To permanently delete the user within Office 365, first delete the user in the Office 365 Admin Portal or using Powershell. Then, connect to your Azure Active Directory environment with Powershell using the “Connect-MsolService” cmdlet.</description>

      <description>This article will discuss an issue regarding WSUS failing to download updates from Microsoft Update servers. You may notice that the home page of your WSUS console states that it has downloaded 0MB of updates:&#xA;You may also see this event (or similar) in the Event Log.&#xA;This problem is caused by not specifying a valid path when assigning the WSUS content drive when first installing the role. The first time you load the WSUS console after installing the role, you will be prompted to specify the path to store Windows Update files.</description>

      <description>Ran into this error message when configuring a new WSUS server:&#xA;Restarted the WSUS, WID, and IIS services to no avail. I even rebooted the server. The WSUS console would work for a short period of time, and then would randomly stop working.&#xA;I found that the WSUS app pool in IIS was being disabled anytime new clients connected to the server. I believe this was because the app pool was running out of usable memory.</description>

Usually WDS is rock solid and it just works.&#xA;Anyway, I was getting ready to deploy some servers in my lab and found that I couldn’t get WDS to start on my deployment server. I got this error message when trying to start the service:&#xA;I then tried to start the service from the Services console and got this error message:&#xA;“This was just working yesterday”, I said to myself.</description>

      <description>The title says it all. This script will move all disabled AD objects to a specified OU. This script accepts parameters that will allow you to specify whether you want to move Users or Computers and the destination OU. It also accepts a “test mode” parameter that will run the script and output the results, without actually modifying Active Directory.&#xA;This is revision 1 of the script. There are still several improvements I would like to make, including better error handling and recovery.</description>

The server was an Exchange 2013 box, and was used in Coexistence mode to migrate his company from an Exchange 2007 box.&#xA;He was getting this error message when attempting to login:&#xA;This is a classic error message that I’m sure most technicians have seen before.</description>

      <description>Ran into a problem earlier with the new Azure AD Connect Wizard. We had configured the wizard and synced around 500 AD accounts. However, password sync was not working. I opened the wizard to confirm the configuration and found that “Password Hash Synchronization” was disabled. It was greyed out and could not be enabled.&#xA;I called Microsoft and worked for a couple hours with a technician to resolve the issue. Thought I should post the resolution here in case anyone else encounters this.</description>

      <description>Believe it or not, the MSP I work for still has a client who is using Exchange 2003 as their primary email service. Despite several attempts at convincing them of the power of Office 365, they refuse to migrate. Last week the CFO contacted me and requested we provide them with a report of all users who have their email forwarded to another mailbox. “Ok, no problem.” I said helpfully as the client informed me of their request (at the time I didn’t even think about them having Exchange 2003…).</description>

      <description>I generally use NMAP for any type of host discovery, but recently started experimenting with FPing. One thing I found is that, when performing a ping sweep, not only do I see the hosts that replied to the ping, but FPing also sends any unreachable IP addresses to stdout (which is super annoying and ugly if you ask me…).&#xA;Anyway, after a bit of research, I found a nifty way to suppress these messages.</description>

      <description>Branchcache is a technology unique to Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2. It provides faster connection to shared files across wide area networks. Branchcache works by caching content hosted on remote servers on a local caching server in the LAN. When a client queries for data on a remote server, it first looks in the local caching server. If the data is not found there, the remote server is accessed and transfer’s the data to the local caching server, where it is then accessed by the client who originally made the request.</description>

      <description>File history in Windows 8 allows users to automatically “backup” files that are in their libraries, contacts, favorites, Skydrive, and on the desktop. If the files are lost, they can be quickly restored. You can also restore a file from a specific point in time, being that File History creates a complete history of your files over time. You will need a separate drive other than the one you have Windows 8 installed on to use File History.</description>

The access layer, the distribution layer, and the core layer. The access layer generally has a high port density, can support VLANs, QoS, and access lists.</description>

      <description>Many people rarely pay close attention to those pesky User Account Control prompts that pop up when attempting to run a program as an administrator. When a user logs into her account, she is assigned a security token based on the level of access that she has (basic user or admin). This token is what defines what programs are allowed to do. Using this concept, the users session is incapable of making changes that would affect the entire system.</description>

I find that documenting these things not only helps others but also helps reinforce my own knowledge as well. I may also blog about life or other random things from time to time.&#xA;This blog has had many lives over the years. It originally started as a Blogger blog way back in 2012, moved to Wordpress for a while, then back to blogger, then to Ghost (running on a small droplet over @ DigitalOcean), then back to Wordpress again, and now here on Github pages.</description>
