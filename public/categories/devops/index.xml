      <description>Despite being a great language, PowerShell is not impervious to errors. Errors that occur within your code can stop it&amp;rsquo;s execution or even cause unexpected changes in the resources that your script is managing. Learning to handle these errors gracefully is the foundation of defensive coding. Today, we&amp;rsquo;ll take a quick look at how PowerShell handles errors with Try-Catch-Finally blocks. They allow you to gracefully handle errors and perform cleanup operations, ensuring that your script doesn&amp;rsquo;t crash when the unexpected occurs.</description>

      <description>This will be a quick and dirty post, so please forgive any spelling/grammar mistakes.&#xA;I was writing a little CLI tool in Golang to track todo items. Just a dumb little app to help hone my skills a bit, but still something useful that serves a purpose to me. I don&amp;rsquo;t write a ton of code at work (mostly just scripting/pipelines when I do), so I&amp;rsquo;m constantly working on something like this in my spare time.</description>

      <description>In this article, we&amp;rsquo;ll take a quick look at building a Golang app with Github actions. This process can be applied to just about any app written in any language though. We&amp;rsquo;ll cover the following:&#xA;What are github actions? Setting up the workflow to build, test, and deploy a binary Github Actions is a cross-platform CI/CD pipeline that allows you to build, test, package, and release your software. Actions can be triggered manually or based on events that happen within your Github repo.</description>

      <description>In this article, we&amp;rsquo;ll take a quick look at chaining two pipelines together in Azure Devops, so that the completion of one pipeline, triggers the other to run. Microsoft documentation is leaps and bounds ahead of where it used to be. However, I still feel like there is a lot of room for improvement, as it took me a while to figure this out.&#xA;Our two pipelines will exist in the same repository.</description>

      <description>If you need to update the secret for a service principal in Azure Devops, prior to it expiring, you may be surprised to find that this cannot be done via the Azure Portal.&#xA;In this article, I&amp;rsquo;ll show you two methods for updating a secret for a service principal prior to expiration.&#xA;Update the secret via the Azure Devops Portal: Link to heading Go to &amp;ldquo;Service Connections&amp;rdquo; in the Azure Devops portal Find the SPN you want to update, then click &amp;ldquo;Manage Service Principal&amp;rdquo; Then on the service principal page, click Certificates &amp;amp; Secrets Create a &amp;ldquo;New Client Secret&amp;rdquo;, take note of the value Delete the &amp;lsquo;old&amp;rsquo; secret Return to the Service Connection in the Azure Devops portal Click Edit - click the verify button.</description>
