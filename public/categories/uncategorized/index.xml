      <description>We can inject configuration into containers using Kubernetes config maps and secrets. These objects can be consumed by a pod as environment variables, command-line arguments, or as configuration files mounted in a volume. For the subject of this article, we will focus on mounting multiple config maps/secrets into a single directory on a pod.
Mounting a configmap or secret in a Volume is relatively straightforward (for anyone familiar with Kubernetes primitives).</description>

      <description>This article assumes that you have already created a pipeline in Azure Devops and have it linked to an Azure Devops repo. You will need to create a variable named $vmpassword and assign it the value stored in your key vault.
To create a release pipeline that will automatically create a VM (using the password stored in key vault for the local administrator account), do the following:

      <description>I setup a self hosted agent for Azure Devops this morning on Server 2012 R2 (legacy Visual Studio dependencies…) and found that I was unable to start the service. The error I received was “Error 1 Incorrect Function” when attempting to start the service in services.msc.
I was attempting to run the agent from within my user profile downloads folder. I originally was not aware the service would be running from this directory.</description>

      <description>This will be the first article in a series about maintaining Azure tenants and subscriptions.
If you currently, or have ever, worked in a large Azure environment, you know how easily resource creep can occur. Resource Groups, VM disks and network interfaces, network security groups, etc. can easily fall out of sight and be forgotten about. This isn’t a big concern for resources that are free of cost, like resource groups.</description>

      <description>I recently passed the AZ-303 exam. Below are some of the resources I used to prepare for the exam. In addition to the links below, I also used Alan Rodrigues’ course on Udemy. 
https://www.udemy.com/course/az-102-azure-administrator-certification-transition/ 
The Udemy course and Microsoft Docs are enough to pass the exam. The course has some good practice exams and labs that align well with what you’ll see on the real exam regarding difficulty. I was scoring in the high 90’s on the Udemy exams.</description>

      <description>I recently ran into a situation in my lab environment that required I resync all (2000+) user accounts to Azure AD. Though this sounds complex and daunting, its actually quite simple. T
The basic steps involve disabling sync, and then removing the user objects. This can all be done with two PowerShell commands:
1) Set-MsolDirSyncEnabled -EnableDirSync $false

2) Get-MsolUser -All | Remove-MsolUser -force

The account that you are currently running the commands as will not be removed.</description>

      <description>If you are using VM Scale Sets in Azure, you know how important it can be to quickly obtain an instance IP address. This can of course be done using the Azure Portal. However, I am often working in a shell or VSCode, and I do not want to leave the comfort of my shell to login to the portal.
There are a few options we have for retrieving information about a VMSS and its instances without using the Azure Portal.</description>

      <description>Azure Policy allows us to control what actions users can perform regarding creating and managing resources in Azure. We can define policies for naming standards, require that certain extensions be installed on virtual machines, audit various resources for certain configurations… the possibilities are endless.
In this article, well focus on defining what locations users can deploy resources in. To get started, login to the Azure Portal and search for “Policy”.</description>

      <description>Let’s say you have a VM in Azure North Central. You created this VM from a custom image that you maintain in an Azure image repository. Now, what if you wanted to create that same VM in Azure South Central, and use the same reference image? A standard image repository is limited to the region that it exists in. The answer here is to create a Shared Image Library, add the image to it, and then configure the image to replicate to other Azure regions.</description>

      <description>In Redhat/Fedora/Cent, GRUB can be protected by running the grub-md5-crypt command and pasting the outputted password hash into the grub.conf file. vSphere 6.0 password protects grub by default. If you change the root password in the VAMI, the GRUB password is changed to match. If you do not change the root password, the GRUB password is “vmware”.
To reset the GRUB password, we need to boot into a Cent or Redhat live CD.</description>

Change server name and IP address Configure time settings and NTP
In this post we will be reviewing the basic installation of the Active Directory Domain Services role and setup of a new forest on Windows Server Core 2019.
To get started, login to your server with administrator privileges. You will first need to type in “powershell” in the cmd prompt to start powershell. Once you do that, type in the following command to install the Active Directory Domain Services role:</description>

      <description>Problem:
Deploying a brand new vCSA 6.7 appliance results in the following error during the second stage of the deployment.

Solution:
This problem is almost always caused by DNS resolution. Once you create the appropriate A and PTR record for your appliance on a LOCAL DNS server, you should be to successfully complete the deployment. Local DNS resolution is required, you cannot use a public DNS server while installing vCenter.</description>

      <description>I ran into this issue this morning when attempting to setup a VPN on a Hyper-V virtual machine. After an hour of searching the Google machine and troubleshooting, I came upon this solution.

Upon installation, AnyConnect pulls down a profile from the ASA containing several settings. This profile is in xml format and is located (on a Windows machine) at %programdata%CiscoCisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility ClientProfileAnyConnectProfile.xsd.
To resolve this issue and connect to your VPN, open this file with notepad (or any text editor, run as admin), search for the “WindowsVPNEstablishment” tag, and modify the value.</description>

      <description>When migrating computer objects using the Active Directory Migration Tool, you may encounter the following error:

In addition, the Migration Log may show the following error:

This is typically caused by a host-side firewall. To resolve this, deploy a GPO to disable the Windows firewall prior to migrating the computer account. I like to create a special OU for computers (I typically name it “PreMigration”) that I will move computer objects to prior to migrating them.</description>

      <description>When replicating virtual machines from VMware to Azure using Site Recovery, you may encounter an issue where the Configuration server discovers the wrong IP address for a VM. This can be caused by stale entries within the infrastructurevms MySQL table that is used by ASR to track VM attributes.
To resolve this issue, you first need to disable replication for the VM in the Azure Portal.

Next, login to your ASR Configuration Server and open a CMD prompt as administrator.</description>

      <description>This morning, I ran into an issue with Azure AD Connect that I had never seen before. I received an email alert from Azure AD stating that Password Synchronization was not working for my forest, and the suggested fix was to restart the ADSync service on the server. I restarted the service and then forced a sync to verify it was working.
After forcing the sync, I opened miisclient and noticed some strange errors.</description>

      <description>I recently had to create a new Azure AD Connect server, and found that it was not able to report health status in the Azure Portal. After some troubleshooting/research, I was able to get the health status report working by registering the health agent on the server with Azure AD Health Services. Doing this involves running one PowerShell cmdlet on your AD Connect server and providing global administrator credentials.</description>

      <description>In an organization with multiple Active Directory forests, you may want to sync objects from trusted forests. Adding trusted forests to Azure AD Sync is a simple process that I will likely cover in a future article. The focus of this post is the not-so-obvious process of removing a forest from Azure AD Connect. This can be a daunting and somewhat scary thing to do. Not fully understanding the process or having someone to guide you can leave you with thoughts like “what happens when I remove the forest from Azure AD Sync?</description>

      <description>While attempting to decommission one of our vCenter sites, I ran into an issue removing one of the PSCs. This site consisted of two PSCs and one vCenter appliance. I removed the first PSC from the SSO domain successfully, and then removed the vCenter appliance. Things became a little tricky during the removal of the final PSC. This PSC did not get removed even after running the cmsso-util command. This article will detail the steps I took in decommissioning the site, as well as removing the stubborn PSC.</description>

      <description>These days, it seems every Microsoft product comes with its own unique set of head scratchers. Microsoft Exchange Server is no exception to this. I was installing Exchange 2016 earlier today, to be used as a hybrid configuration server for Office 365 (no local mailboxes). I downloaded the self depackaging executable from Microsoft, and attempted to install it. If you currently have a hybrid configuration (which we did, with Exchange 2010), the Exchange 2016 installer will detect this and run some tests to verify that the Office 365 tenant is ready for Exchange 2016 (more info here: https://technet.</description>

      <description>File history in Windows 8 allows users to automatically “backup” files that are in their libraries, contacts, favorites, Skydrive, and on the desktop. If the files are lost, they can be quickly restored. You can also restore a file from a specific point in time, being that File History creates a complete history of your files over time. You will need a separate drive other than the one you have Windows 8 installed on to use File History.</description>

      <description>After deleting a user in Office 365, their account is moved to a ‘recycle bin’ for 30 days. This allows the user account to be easily recovered. This can often cause issues when attempting to recreate a mailbox while a hybrid configuration is in place.
To permanently delete the user within Office 365, first delete the user in the Office 365 Admin Portal or using Powershell. Then, connect to your Azure Active Directory environment with Powershell using the “Connect-MsolService” cmdlet.</description>

To resolve this, open ADUC and show advanced features (Click View &amp;gt; Advanced Features). Then find the object for the dynamic distribution group and open the properties window. Browse to the “Object” tab and uncheck the “Protect object from accidental deletion” box. Wait for ADDS to replicate or force replication yourself.

Go back to the ECP and you should be able to delete the group.</description>

      <description>In this post I’ll be walking through how to run a vSphere lab in VMware Workstation. I recently decided to obtain VCP6-DCV. Rather than driving up my electric bill like I’ve done in the past using physical servers, I’m attempting to run the entire lab on my workstation and a Synology NAS.
If you’ve ever installed ESXi, installing it in Workstation will be a familiar process for you. VMware tools is included in the installation disc, which makes installing ESXi in Workstation dramatically easier than it used to be.</description>

      <description>This article will discuss an issue regarding WSUS failing to download updates from Microsoft Update servers. You may notice that the home page of your WSUS console states that it has downloaded 0MB of updates:

You may also see this event (or similar) in the Event Log.

This problem is caused by not specifying a valid path when assigning the WSUS content drive when first installing the role. The first time you load the WSUS console after installing the role, you will be prompted to specify the path to store Windows Update files.</description>

      <description>Ran into this error message when configuring a new WSUS server:

Restarted the WSUS, WID, and IIS services to no avail. I even rebooted the server. The WSUS console would work for a short period of time, and then would randomly stop working.
I found that the WSUS app pool in IIS was being disabled anytime new clients connected to the server. I believe this was because the app pool was running out of usable memory.</description>

Anyway, I was getting ready to deploy some servers in my lab and found that I couldn’t get WDS to start on my deployment server. I got this error message when trying to start the service:

I then tried to start the service from the Services console and got this error message:</description>

      <description>The title says it all. This script will move all disabled AD objects to a specified OU. This script accepts parameters that will allow you to specify whether you want to move Users or Computers and the destination OU. It also accepts a “test mode” parameter that will run the script and output the results, without actually modifying Active Directory.
This is revision 1 of the script. There are still several improvements I would like to make, including better error handling and recovery.</description>

      <description>One of my clients had a really strange issue the other day. He has a domain admin account in his domain and was not able to login to a server that I recently built. The server was an Exchange 2013 box, and was used in Coexistence mode to migrate his company from an Exchange 2007 box.
He was getting this error message when attempting to login:

This is a classic error message that I’m sure most technicians have seen before.</description>

      <description>Ran into a problem earlier with the new Azure AD Connect Wizard. We had configured the wizard and synced around 500 AD accounts. However, password sync was not working. I opened the wizard to confirm the configuration and found that “Password Hash Synchronization” was disabled. It was greyed out and could not be enabled.

I called Microsoft and worked for a couple hours with a technician to resolve the issue.</description>

      <description>Believe it or not, the MSP I work for still has a client who is using Exchange 2003 as their primary email service. Despite several attempts at convincing them of the power of Office 365, they refuse to migrate. Last week the CFO contacted me and requested we provide them with a report of all users who have their email forwarded to another mailbox. “Ok, no problem.” I said helpfully as the client informed me of their request (at the time I didn’t even think about them having Exchange 2003…).</description>

I restored the database that the users’ mailbox was on from a backup then copied it over to the Exchange server from the network share I restored it to. All was going well, until I tried to mount the darn thing.</description>

      <description>I generally use NMAP for any type of host discovery, but recently started experimenting with FPing. One thing I found is that, when performing a ping sweep, not only do I see the hosts that replied to the ping, but FPing also sends any unreachable IP addresses to stdout (which is super annoying and ugly if you ask me…).

Anyway, after a bit of research, I found a nifty way to suppress these messages.</description>

There are 4 different types of Applocker RULES that you can implement, depending on what type of executable you want to control access to.
Executable Rules – EXE’s, COM’s, etc.
Script Rules – batch files, VB scripts, etc.
AppX Rules – AppX Packages (Windows 8.</description>

      <description>Branchcache is a technology unique to Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2. It provides faster connection to shared files across wide area networks. Branchcache works by caching content hosted on remote servers on a local caching server in the LAN. When a client queries for data on a remote server, it first looks in the local caching server. If the data is not found there, the remote server is accessed and transfer’s the data to the local caching server, where it is then accessed by the client who originally made the request.</description>

      <description>File history in Windows 8 allows users to automatically “backup” files that are in their libraries, contacts, favorites, Skydrive, and on the desktop. If the files are lost, they can be quickly restored. You can also restore a file from a specific point in time, being that File History creates a complete history of your files over time. You will need a separate drive other than the one you have Windows 8 installed on to use File History.</description>

      <description>Many people rarely pay close attention to those pesky User Account Control prompts that pop up when attempting to run a program as an administrator. When a user logs into her account, she is assigned a security token based on the level of access that she has (basic user or admin). This token is what defines what programs are allowed to do. Using this concept, the users session is incapable of making changes that would affect the entire system.</description>
