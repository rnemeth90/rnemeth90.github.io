      <description>&lt;p&gt;Despite being a great language, PowerShell is not impervious to errors. Errors that occur within your code can stop it&amp;rsquo;s execution or even cause unexpected changes in the resources that your script is managing. Learning to handle these errors gracefully is the foundation of defensive coding. Today, we&amp;rsquo;ll take a quick look at how PowerShell handles errors with Try-Catch-Finally blocks. They allow you to gracefully handle errors and perform cleanup operations, ensuring that your script doesn&amp;rsquo;t crash when the unexpected occurs. We&amp;rsquo;ll then cover the differences in terminating and non-terminating errors and why you should take these into consideration when implementing error handling.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Powershell for Devops - Querying REST APIs with Powershell</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This will be a short post on querying REST APIs with Powershell.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s hard to argue that REST APIs are the predominant technology for interacting&#xA;with networked services. They provide a gateway for interacting with a 3rd party (or self-hosted)&#xA;product without having to go through the exercise of a more complicated integration. REST APIs communicate&#xA;in a common format, typically JSON. However, most will allow us to choose the response format by specifying an&#xA;option in the &amp;lsquo;Accept&amp;rsquo; header.  Most languages provide a native method for interacting with&#xA;REST APIs. This objective for this post is to show you how simple this is with Powershell.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
