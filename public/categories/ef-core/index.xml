      <description>This problem has bitten me more than once, and I can never remember how to fix it. So, why not write a blog post about it!&#xA;When running EF Core migrations in a solution, you may come across this error:&#xA;There are several apparent causes. However, in my case (every time I have seen this), it has been caused by having multiple startup projects selected in Visual Studio.&#xA;To fix this, simply open your Solution properties and set the startup project to ‘Current Selection’.</description>
