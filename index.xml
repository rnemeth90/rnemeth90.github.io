&lt;p>This post covers a simple and efficient solution for implementing liveness probes in pods running console applications (think background services or utility DaemonSets). A common question I see in Kubernetes forums is:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>“How do I use health probes with console apps?”
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>The typical responses often suggest:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Sidecar Container with HTTP Server: Requires coding the server, building a sidecar container, and managing additional infrastructure. While effective, this can be overkill for lightweight applications.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Exec Probes with Shell Scripts: Feels hacky and can waste resources, depending on what the script does.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Pods are meant to be lightweight, and both solutions can deviate from that principle.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Mounting Multiple Kubernetes Secrets into One Directory</title><link>https://rnemeth90.github.io/posts/2024-06-29-mount-multiple-kubernetes-secrets-into-one-directory/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rnemeth90.github.io/posts/2024-06-29-mount-multiple-kubernetes-secrets-into-one-directory/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="introduction">

&lt;p>Knowing the type of a file you&amp;rsquo;re working with is not just a matter of curiosity — it&amp;rsquo;s often a necessity. This is especially true when you&amp;rsquo;re deciding whether or not a particular operation can be carried out on that file. Go, with its comprehensive standard library, offers a straightforward approach to identifying a file&amp;rsquo;s MIME type, ensuring that developers have the tools they need to make informed decisions about file manipulation. You may expect to find this functionality in the &lt;code>file&lt;/code> package, but you&amp;rsquo;d be wrong!

&lt;p>In this post, we&amp;rsquo;ll take a quick look at URL validation using Golang. It&amp;rsquo;s common to implement URL validation as a task within a HTTP request pipeline, typically as middleware. There are many different definitions of &amp;ldquo;validation&amp;rdquo;. For the purpose of this article, we will simply validate that a URL conforms to a particular text pattern.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I often see people (mistakenly) use URL and URI interchangeably. URL is actually is a sub-type of URI. A URL is a reference to a web resource, typically seen as a web address (e.g. &lt;a href="https://golang.org/project/%29" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://golang.org/project/)&lt;/a>. A URI, on the other hand, can be used to identify any type of resource, not just those on the internet.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Nginx Ingress Response Header Size - A Cautionary Tale</title><link>https://rnemeth90.github.io/posts/2023-12-04-nginx-ingress-resp-header-size/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rnemeth90.github.io/posts/2023-12-04-nginx-ingress-resp-header-size/</guid><description>&lt;p>This will be a short post about a recent issue I encountered when using Nginx as a Kubernetes ingress.

&lt;p>Netcat is a versatile networking utility that can be used for a wide range of tasks. It has often been referred to as the &amp;ldquo;network swiss-army knife&amp;rdquo;. Netcat was first released in the mid-90s, and I personally find it ironic to be blogging about it in 2023!

Errors that occur within your code can stop it&amp;rsquo;s execution or even cause unexpected changes in the resources that your script is managing. Learning to handle these errors gracefully is the foundation of defensive coding. Today, we&amp;rsquo;ll take a quick look at how PowerShell handles errors with Try-Catch-Finally blocks. They allow you to gracefully handle errors and perform cleanup operations, ensuring that your script doesn&amp;rsquo;t crash when the unexpected occurs. We&amp;rsquo;ll then cover the differences in terminating and non-terminating errors and why you should take these into consideration when implementing error handling.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Golang: When Identical Strings are Not Equal</title><link>https://rnemeth90.github.io/posts/2023-01-24-golang-strings-not-equal/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rnemeth90.github.io/posts/2023-01-24-golang-strings-not-equal/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>This will be a quick and dirty post, so please forgive any spelling/grammar mistakes.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

figure this out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our two pipelines will exist in the same repository. We have a dependent-pipeline, that we only want to run once the source-pipeline is finished. This is useful if you have

 Update the secret via the Azure Devops Portal:

&lt;li>Find the SPN you want to update, then click &amp;ldquo;Manage Service Principal&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Then on the service principal page, click Certificates &amp;amp; Secrets&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create a &amp;ldquo;New Client Secret&amp;rdquo;, take note of the value&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Delete the &amp;lsquo;old&amp;rsquo; secret&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Return to the Service Connection in the Azure Devops portal&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Click Edit - click the verify button. It should tell you the client certificate has expired&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Now you need to make an arbitrary change and save it. I just type a character in the optional description and save.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Now edit again and click verify, it will now pick up the new client secret and all is happy.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s hard to argue that REST APIs are the predominant technology for interacting
with networked services. They provide a gateway for interacting with a 3rd party (or self-hosted)
product without having to go through the exercise of a more complicated integration. REST APIs communicate
in a common format, typically JSON. However, most will allow us to choose the response format by specifying an
option in the &amp;lsquo;Accept&amp;rsquo; header. Most languages provide a native method for interacting with
REST APIs. This objective for this post is to show you how simple this is with Powershell.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Reading Json Files with Go</title><link>https://rnemeth90.github.io/posts/2022-07-21-reading-json-files-with-go/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rnemeth90.github.io/posts/2022-07-21-reading-json-files-with-go/</guid><description>&lt;p>JSON is a widely used format for representing structured data.

Scale-down mode is a relatively newer concept that allows us to choose whether to delete &lt;em>or&lt;/em> deallocate nodes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Having the ability to deallocate, rather than delete, nodes is a major performance benefit, as the time it takes to spin up new nodes will be significantly decreased. You will not be charged when nodes are deallocated. However, you will still need to pay for any storage that the node is using. Having persistent storage also means that any container images that were cached on the node will still be there when the node starts back up. This can be a major performance benefit if you are using Windows containers because the images for these containers are typically very large.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Scheduled Kubernetes Worker Node Maintenance with Kured</title><link>https://rnemeth90.github.io/posts/2022-07-15-scheduled-kubernetes-worker-node-maintenance-with-kured/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Jul 2022 18:18:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rnemeth90.github.io/posts/2022-07-15-scheduled-kubernetes-worker-node-maintenance-with-kured/</guid><description>&lt;p>If you manage Linux nodes, you know how vital performing regular maintenance is.

&lt;p>A namespace is like a container. You can use it to store related objects in a Kubernetes environment. Maybe you are hosting a blog in Kubernetes. This blog will likely have a database, a frontend website, a load balancer (service) to spread the incoming traffic among ‘x’ number of frontend containers (pods), and maybe some middle-tier or utility applications. One day, you decide you no longer want this blog, so you plan to delete it. Rather than tediously deleting all of the various entities associated with this blog, you can delete the namespace that contains these entities. This will essentially ‘cascade delete’ the resources within the namespace as well.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Injecting multiple Kubernetes volumes to the same directory in a pod</title><link>https://rnemeth90.github.io/posts/2022-04-30-injecting-multiple-kubernetes-volumes-to-the-same-directory-in-a-pod/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Apr 2022 14:21:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rnemeth90.github.io/posts/2022-04-30-injecting-multiple-kubernetes-volumes-to-the-same-directory-in-a-pod/</guid><description>&lt;p>We can inject configuration into containers using Kubernetes config maps and secrets.

&lt;p>Azure Key Vault is an Azure cloud service used to securely store secrets, keys, and certificates. A secret can be any string of characters, such as API keys, passwords, URLs, etc. Azure Key Vault encrypts data at rest and in transit using HTTPS. Depending on the type of Key Vault you are using, data at rest is encrypted using software encryption (AES 256) or HSM-backed keys.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Kubernetes Pod Eviction</title><link>https://rnemeth90.github.io/posts/2022-02-05-kubernetes-pod-eviction/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Feb 2022 23:49:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rnemeth90.github.io/posts/2022-02-05-kubernetes-pod-eviction/</guid><description>&lt;p>In this article, we will dive into the process of pod eviction in a Kubernetes cluster, how you can pod prevent pod eviction, and how you can recover from such a situation.&lt;/p>

You may notice that the home page of your WSUS console states that it has downloaded 0MB of updates:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This problem is caused by not specifying a valid path when assigning the WSUS content drive when first installing the role. The first time you load the WSUS console after installing the role, you will be prompted to specify the path to store Windows Update files. WSUS does not like to have its content directory be the root of a partition. For example, if I were to specify “e:” as the path for the Windows Update content, the wizard would give you an error message stating that the path is not valid. However, it doesn’t prompt you to re-enter the path if you click close. The WSUS console opens immediately after and that invalid path is where WSUS will try to store your update files. This is and has been a known bug for a while and needs to be addressed by Microsoft. Evidence of the invalid path can be found in the registry under:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Active Directory Migration Toolkit The RPC Server is Unavailable</title><link>https://rnemeth90.github.io/posts/2022-01-14-active-directory-migration-toolkit-the-rpc-server-is-unavailable/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Jan 2022 21:55:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rnemeth90.github.io/posts/2022-01-14-active-directory-migration-toolkit-the-rpc-server-is-unavailable/</guid><description>&lt;p>When migrating computer objects using the Active Directory Migration Tool, you may encounter the following error:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This is typically caused by a host-side firewall. To resolve this, deploy a GPO to disable the Windows firewall prior to migrating the computer account. I like to create a special OU for computers (I typically name it “PreMigration”) that I will move computer objects to prior to migrating them. This OU will have two policies applied. One to disable the Windows Firewall and another to start the Remote Registry service.

&lt;p>Blue/green deployments are a deployment model where a new application version never gets deployed to the production servers (green) directly. Instead, it gets deployed to another set of servers (blue) first. Since the blue servers are not currently serving any traffic for users, the deployment has no impact. However, once the deployment has been completed successfully and tested, users will be directed to the new deployment (blue). You can control all user traffic or a subset of user traffic if your load balancer supports it (referred to as ‘Progressive Exposure’).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Deploy Azure VMs Using Azure Devops CI/CD Pipeline</title><link>https://rnemeth90.github.io/posts/2022-01-14-deploy-azure-vms-using-azure-devops-ci-cd-pipeline/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Jan 2022 18:46:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rnemeth90.github.io/posts/2022-01-14-deploy-azure-vms-using-azure-devops-ci-cd-pipeline/</guid><description>&lt;p>This article assumes that you have already created a pipeline in Azure Devops and have it linked to an Azure Devops repo.

&lt;p>I was attempting to run the agent from within my user profile downloads folder. I originally was not aware the service would be running from this directory. I thought it would copy its binary files to program files directory or programdata, like 99% of all other apps. The service installs and attempts to run itself as the “network service” authority. This account does not have permission to a user profile folder by default, and the installation script is not able to grant it permission for some reason (I didn’t investigate this further). I removed the agent, moved the installation files to the root of c:, and then reinstalled.

Resource Groups, VM disks and network interfaces, network security groups, etc. can easily fall out of sight and be forgotten about. This isn’t a big concern for resources that are free of cost, like resource groups. However, if you delete several virtual machines, the disks that were attached to those virtual machines linger, and you continue to pay the cost of storing them.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Exam AZ-303: Microsoft Azure Architect Technologies Study Guide</title><link>https://rnemeth90.github.io/posts/2020-12-16-exam-az-303-microsoft-azure-architect/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Dec 2020 14:44:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rnemeth90.github.io/posts/2020-12-16-exam-az-303-microsoft-azure-architect/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;span style="font-family: arial;">I recently passed the AZ-303 exam.

I like to create a special OU for computers (I typically name it “PreMigration”) that I will move computer objects to prior to migrating them. This OU will have two policies applied. One to disable the Windows Firewall and another to start the Remote Registry service. Both are required for the computer object to successfully migrate.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Azure Site Recovery &amp;#8211; VMware-to-Azure: Wrong IP address discovered for VM</title><link>https://rnemeth90.github.io/posts/2018-08-21-azure-site-recovery-vmware-to-azure/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Aug 2018 17:26:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rnemeth90.github.io/posts/2018-08-21-azure-site-recovery-vmware-to-azure/</guid><description>&lt;p>When replicating virtual machines from VMware to Azure using Site Recovery, you may encounter an issue where the Configuration server discovers the wrong IP address for a VM. This can be caused by stale entries within the infrastructurevms MySQL table that is used by ASR to track VM attributes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To resolve this issue, you first need to disable replication for the VM in the Azure Portal.&lt;/p>

I restarted the service and then forced a sync to verify it was working.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After forcing the sync, I opened miisclient and noticed some strange errors. We sync multiple on-prem AD forests to Azure AD, and the status for one of them was “no-start-connection”. That error in itself does not seem significant to me. However, after clicking on the “failed-connection” link in the Connection Status pane, things became much more clear.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Azure AD Connect Health: Latest Data is not Available in Azure Portal</title><link>https://rnemeth90.github.io/posts/2018-07-18-azure-ad-connect-health-latest-data-is/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Jul 2018 16:38:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rnemeth90.github.io/posts/2018-07-18-azure-ad-connect-health-latest-data-is/</guid><description>&lt;p>I recently had to create a new Azure AD Connect server, and found that it was not able to report health status in the Azure Portal.

Adding trusted forests to Azure AD Sync is a simple process that I will likely cover in a future article. The focus of this post is the not-so-obvious process of removing a forest from Azure AD Connect. This can be a daunting and somewhat scary thing to do. Not fully understanding the process or having someone to guide you can leave you with thoughts like “what happens when I remove the forest from Azure AD Sync? Do on-premises objects get deleted? Are cloud objects deleted?”. I will try to answer these questions to the best of my ability and hopefully make the process simple and stress-free for you.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Remove Stubborn PSC or vCenter Appliance from an SSO Domain</title><link>https://rnemeth90.github.io/posts/2017-11-08-remove-stubborn-psc-or-vcenter/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Nov 2017 07:56:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rnemeth90.github.io/posts/2017-11-08-remove-stubborn-psc-or-vcenter/</guid><description>&lt;p>While attempting to decommission one of our vCenter sites, I ran into an issue removing one of the PSCs.

Microsoft Exchange Server is no exception to this. I was installing Exchange 2016 earlier today, to be used as a hybrid configuration server for Office 365 (no local mailboxes). I downloaded the self depackaging executable from Microsoft, and attempted to install it. If you currently have a hybrid configuration (which we did, with Exchange 2010), the Exchange 2016 installer will detect this and run some tests to verify that the Office 365 tenant is ready for Exchange 2016 (more info here: &lt;a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms.exch.setup.hybridconfigurationstatuspage%28v=exchg.160%29.aspx" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms.exch.setup.hybridconfigurationstatuspage(v=exchg.160).aspx&lt;/a>).

&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Create new server and install WDS role.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Stop WDS Service on old server&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Stop WDS Service on new server&lt;/li>

&lt;p>This problem is caused by not specifying a valid path when assigning the WSUS content drive when first installing the role. The first time you load the WSUS console after installing the role, you will be prompted to specify the path to store Windows Update files. WSUS does not like to have its content directory be the root of a partition. For example, if I were to specify “e:” as the path for the Windows Update content, the wizard would give you an error message stating that the path is not valid. However, it doesn’t prompt you to re-enter the path if you click close. The WSUS console opens immediately after and that invalid path is where WSUS will try to store your update files. This is and has been a known bug for a while and needs to be addressed by Microsoft. Evidence of the invalid path can be found in the registry under:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>WSUS: An error occurred trying to connect the WSUS server</title><link>https://rnemeth90.github.io/posts/2016-11-10-wsus-an-error-occurred-trying-to-connect-the-wsus-server/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Nov 2016 15:18:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rnemeth90.github.io/posts/2016-11-10-wsus-an-error-occurred-trying-to-connect-the-wsus-server/</guid><description>&lt;p>Ran into this error message when configuring a new WSUS server:&lt;/p>

Despite several attempts at convincing them of the power of Office 365, they refuse to migrate. Last week the CFO contacted me and requested we provide them with a report of all users who have their email forwarded to another mailbox. “Ok, no problem.” I said helpfully as the client informed me of their request (at the time I didn’t even think about them having Exchange 2003…). I figured I would just connect to their server and do some quick PowerShell magic, and that would be it. Quick and painless, right? Wrong.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Script for Querying All AD Computers Time Source</title><link>https://rnemeth90.github.io/posts/2015-09-01-script-for-querying-all-ad-computers-time-source/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Sep 2015 21:05:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rnemeth90.github.io/posts/2015-09-01-script-for-querying-all-ad-computers-time-source/</guid><description>&lt;p>This script will iterate through all computers in Active Directory and return the configured time server for each computer.&lt;/p>

One thing I found is that, when performing a ping sweep, not only do I see the hosts that replied to the ping, but FPing also sends any unreachable IP addresses to stdout (which is super annoying and ugly if you ask me…).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://rnemeth90.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2015-03-08_21h04_50.png" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&lt;img src="https://rnemeth90.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2015-03-08_21h04_50.png">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

It provides faster connection to shared files across wide area networks. Branchcache works by caching content hosted on remote servers on a local caching server in the LAN. When a client queries for data on a remote server, it first looks in the local caching server. If the data is not found there, the remote server is accessed and transfer’s the data to the local caching server, where it is then accessed by the client who originally made the request. That way, all future client requests will not have to go across the wide area network, rather opting to access the local caching server until the data changes.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>File History</title><link>https://rnemeth90.github.io/posts/2014-11-15-file-history/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Nov 2014 20:02:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rnemeth90.github.io/posts/2014-11-15-file-history/</guid><description>&lt;p>File history in Windows 8 allows users to automatically “backup” files that are in their libraries, contacts, favorites, Skydrive, and on the desktop. If the files are lost, they can be quickly restored. You can also restore a file from a specific point in time, being that File History creates a complete history of your files over time. You will need a separate drive other than the one you have Windows 8 installed on to use File History. To begin using it, connect an external drive and search for File History on the Start Screen:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Layer 2 Switching Fundamentals</title><link>https://rnemeth90.github.io/posts/2012-11-16-layer-2-switching-fundamentals/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Nov 2012 21:26:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rnemeth90.github.io/posts/2012-11-16-layer-2-switching-fundamentals/</guid><description>&lt;p>Switches are devices that support a large number of ports to connect devices to the network.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>More towards a CCNP or CCDA topic, but designing a network when it comes to the switching side can be done in three building blocks. The access layer, the distribution layer, and the core layer. The access layer generally has a high port density, can support VLANs, QoS, and access lists. The distribution layer will aggregate multiple access layer switches. These are also generally Layer 3 switches to allow routing among an enterprise. It will need to be able to handle the volume of traffic in addition to supporting the same features as the access layer switches.

Using this concept, the users session is incapable of making changes that would affect the entire system.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>User Account Control</title><link>https://rnemeth90.github.io/posts/2012-11-15-user-account-control/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Nov 2012 16:01:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rnemeth90.github.io/posts/2012-11-15-user-account-control/</guid><description>&lt;p>Many people rarely pay close attention to those pesky User Account Control prompts that pop up when attempting to run a program as an administrator.

&lt;p>My name is Ryan Nemeth and this is my personal blog. I write down my thoughts regarding Microsoft Azure, Kubernetes, cloud-native technologies, and software development. I find that documenting these things not only helps others but also helps reinforce my own knowledge as well. I may also blog about life or other random things from time to time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This blog has had many lives over the years. It originally started as a Blogger blog way back in 2012, moved to Wordpress for a while, then back to blogger, then to Ghost (running on a small droplet over @ DigitalOcean), then back to Wordpress again, and now here on Github pages. That&amp;rsquo;s a lot of change (such is life)! So if you happen to come across a page that has some weird formatting, missing images, etc. Please be kind and let me know so that I may fix it.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
