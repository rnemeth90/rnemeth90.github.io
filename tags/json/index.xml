&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s hard to argue that REST APIs are the predominant technology for interacting
with networked services. They provide a gateway for interacting with a 3rd party (or self-hosted)
product without having to go through the exercise of a more complicated integration. REST APIs communicate
in a common format, typically JSON. However, most will allow us to choose the response format by specifying an
option in the &amp;lsquo;Accept&amp;rsquo; header. Most languages provide a native method for interacting with
REST APIs. This objective for this post is to show you how simple this is with Powershell.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Reading Json Files with Go</title><link>https://rnemeth90.github.io/posts/2022-07-21-reading-json-files-with-go/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rnemeth90.github.io/posts/2022-07-21-reading-json-files-with-go/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;JSON is a widely used format for representing structured data. Developers like it because it is easy to read, most common languages have a library for interacting
with it, and most public APIs accept JSON in HTTP requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post, we&amp;rsquo;ll look at parsing a JSON file using Go! We will be using the io/ioutil package to open a json file on local disk, and encoding/json to parse the
JSON data within the file into a memory structure.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
