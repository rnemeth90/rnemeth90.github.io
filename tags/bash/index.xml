&lt;p&gt;A namespace is like a container. You can use it to store related objects in a Kubernetes environment. Maybe you are hosting a blog in Kubernetes. This blog will likely have a database, a frontend website, a load balancer (service) to spread the incoming traffic among ‘x’ number of frontend containers (pods), and maybe some middle-tier or utility applications. One day, you decide you no longer want this blog, so you plan to delete it. Rather than tediously deleting all of the various entities associated with this blog, you can delete the namespace that contains these entities. This will essentially ‘cascade delete’ the resources within the namespace as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
