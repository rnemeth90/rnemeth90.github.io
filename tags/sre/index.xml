&lt;p&gt;This post covers a simple and efficient solution for implementing liveness probes in pods running console applications (think background services or utility DaemonSets). A common question I see in Kubernetes forums is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;“How do I use health probes with console apps?”
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The typical responses often suggest:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sidecar Container with HTTP Server: Requires coding the server, building a sidecar container, and managing additional infrastructure. While effective, this can be overkill for lightweight applications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exec Probes with Shell Scripts: Feels hacky and can waste resources, depending on what the script does.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pods are meant to be lightweight, and both solutions can deviate from that principle.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Handling Graceful Shutdown in a .NET App Hosted in Kubernetes</title><link>https://rnemeth90.github.io/posts/2022-12-28-graceful-shutdown-in-kubernetes-dotnet-pod/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rnemeth90.github.io/posts/2022-12-28-graceful-shutdown-in-kubernetes-dotnet-pod/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I was recently involved with troubleshooting some API&amp;rsquo;s hosted in Kubernetes throwing http/502&amp;rsquo;s. This was incredibly difficult to diagnose because it seemingly happened at random, and I had never encountered anything like this. Being that I had never dealt with this in the past, and I (nor my team) was able to figure it out within a reasonable amount of time, I turned to google. My searches resulted in various blogs and SO posts of other people experiencing similar issues, but none of their resolutions worked for us. It was actually a combination of these blogs (and the resolutions posted) that ended up resolving our issue.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
