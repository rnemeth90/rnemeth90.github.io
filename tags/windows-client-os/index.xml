After an hour of searching the Google machine and troubleshooting, I came upon this solution.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-BYApW8vZjV8/X33B2Or4D7I/AAAAAAAAxuY/hWQwpE-fqo4xInAsx9vyUvzDJXqxe68QQCLcBGAsYHQ/image.png" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&lt;img src="https://rnemeth90.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-16.png">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Upon installation, AnyConnect pulls down a profile from the ASA containing several settings. This profile is in xml format and is located (on a Windows machine) at %programdata%CiscoCisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility ClientProfileAnyConnectProfile.xsd.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To resolve this issue and connect to your VPN, open this file with notepad (or any text editor, run as admin), search for the “WindowsVPNEstablishment” tag, and modify the value. The default value is “LocalUsersOnly”, you will need to change it to “AllowRemoteUsers”. Save and close the file, then restart the machine.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Windows 8 File History</title><link>https://rnemeth90.github.io/posts/2017-06-22-windows-8-file-history-windows-8-file-history/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jun 2017 22:42:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rnemeth90.github.io/posts/2017-06-22-windows-8-file-history-windows-8-file-history/</guid><description>&lt;p>File history in Windows 8 allows users to automatically “backup” files that are in their libraries, contacts, favorites, Skydrive, and on the desktop. If the files are lost, they can be quickly restored. You can also restore a file from a specific point in time, being that File History creates a complete history of your files over time. You will need a separate drive other than the one you have Windows 8 installed on to use File History. To begin using it, connect an external drive and search for File History on the Start Screen:&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
