If the files are lost, they can be quickly restored. You can also restore a file from a specific point in time, being that File History creates a complete history of your files over time. You will need a separate drive other than the one you have Windows 8 installed on to use File History. To begin using it, connect an external drive and search for File History on the Start Screen:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>User Account Control</title><link>https://rnemeth90.github.io/posts/2012-11-15-user-account-control-copy/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Nov 2012 16:01:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rnemeth90.github.io/posts/2012-11-15-user-account-control-copy/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Many people rarely pay close attention to those pesky User Account Control prompts that pop up when attempting to run a program as an administrator. When a user logs into her account, she is assigned a security token based on the level of access that she has (basic user or admin). This token is what defines what programs are allowed to do. Using this concept, the users session is incapable of making changes that would affect the entire system.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>User Account Control</title><link>https://rnemeth90.github.io/posts/2012-11-15-user-account-control/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Nov 2012 16:01:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rnemeth90.github.io/posts/2012-11-15-user-account-control/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Many people rarely pay close attention to those pesky User Account Control prompts that pop up when attempting to run a program as an administrator.
