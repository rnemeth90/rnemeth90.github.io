I don&amp;rsquo;t particularly enjoy the intracies of tuning a high-end DSLR camera. Nor am I a fan of being out in nature to photograph a fall sunrise (though, that does sound peaceful). However, I do take a lot of pictures with my phone (currently, a Pixel 6). Moreso now that I am a new father. I am protective of these photos. So much that I sync them automatically from my phone to two cloud storage providers. I thought the other day, how painful it would be for either of these cloud storage providers to go offline. Though unlikely, anything is possible, right?&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
