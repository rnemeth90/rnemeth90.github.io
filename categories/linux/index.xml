&lt;p&gt;Minor Page Faults: These occur when a process attempts to access a memory page that is already present in physical RAM but is not yet mapped into the process&amp;rsquo;s own virtual address space. The operating system handles these faults by simply updating the process&amp;rsquo;s page table to include the mapping to the existing page in RAM. This is a relatively fast operation, as no data needs to be loaded from disk. A high number of minor page faults could be indicative of the process uses many shared objects/libraries.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Exploring Netcat</title><link>https://rnemeth90.github.io/posts/2023-11-27-netcat/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rnemeth90.github.io/posts/2023-11-27-netcat/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Netcat is a versatile networking utility that can be used for a wide range of tasks. It has often been referred to as the &amp;ldquo;network swiss-army knife&amp;rdquo;. Netcat was first released in the mid-90s, and I personally find it ironic to be blogging about it in 2023! But I feel like it is a somewhat cryptic tool, and new engineers or college graduates may not be familiar. This article is meant for those people who are not familiar with it, or have only briefly been exposed.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
